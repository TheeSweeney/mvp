There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Skating Weather

## Sub-Heading ##
  A smarter way for skate commuters to wake up.

## Summary ##
  Skating Weather is a trigger based alarm clock that checks the weather for you. Since skating in the rain is dangerous if not impossible, Skating Weather will check the weather and forecast about an hour before your alarm is set. If it has rained or will rain, Skating Weather will adjust your alarm clock to wake you up in time to grab a raincoat and walk to work, class, or wherever you need to go.

## Problem ##
  Skating is a fast way to get to work or class. But if you wake up assuming you can skate in, and it's pouring rain outside, you're going to either be late or ruin the bearings on your skateboard.

## Solution ##
  Skating Weather checks the weather before you wake up, as well as the forecast for soon after your wakeup time, and if will rain, has rained, or is raining, adjusts the users alarm clock so they have enough time to wake up and walk in.

## Quote from You ##
  Walking is for squares.

## How to Get Started ##
  Just hop onto our website, enter in your wakeup time and start-stop location. Leave the webpage open and Skate Weather will do the rest.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I used to be late all the time because I lived in Seattle, but still tried to skate into work every morning. It just wasn't feasible. 3 days a week I'd wake up to see I'd have to catch an uber because it was raining too hard to skate. Not anymore. Now I always wake up with enough time to get to work by my own locomotion, be it skating or walking"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Skate or be late.
